    "### What is Structured Output in LangChain?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured output** is a technique where language models (LLMs) are prompted to return their results in a specific, machine-readable format—such as JSON, lists, tables, or key-value pairs—rather than just free-form text. This is essential for downstream processing and reliable automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Structured Output?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reliable Parsing:** Easily extract values for use in your application.\n",
    "- **Automation:** Automate post-processing, function calls, or data storage.\n",
    "- **Validation:** Ensure the response follows a schema or expected structure.\n",
    "- **Chaining:** Pass structured results between components or chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Achieve Structured Output in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt Engineering:**  \n",
    "   Instruct the LLM to return output in the desired format, e.g.,  \n",
    "   “Return your answer as a JSON object with the fields ‘summary’ and ‘keywords’.”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Parsers:**  \n",
    "   Use LangChain’s built-in output parser classes to validate and extract fields from the LLM’s response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser, ResponseSchema\n",
    "\n",
    "response_schemas = [\n",

    "    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": output_parser.get_format_instructions()}\n",

    "final_prompt = prompt.format(**chain_input)\n",
    "# Pass final_prompt to your LLM and parse with output_parser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Schemas:** Define complex nested data structures for more advanced tasks.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle responses that don’t match the desired format.\n",
    "- **Integration:** Use structured outputs to trigger actions, populate databases, or drive APIs."

    "# Ways to get Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prompt Engineering  \n",
    "Carefully instruct the model to respond in a specific format, such as JSON, a table, or bullet points.  \n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Please summarize the following text. Return the result as a JSON object with \"summary\" and \"keywords\" fields.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Output Parsers  \n",
    "LangChain provides output parsers that check, validate, and extract structured data from the model’s response.  \n",
    "- **StructuredOutputParser:** Works with prompts that request JSON or similar formats.\n",
    "- **PydanticOutputParser:** Uses Pydantic schemas to validate and parse the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Response Schemas  \n",
    "Define a schema for the output (e.g., what fields should be present) and use it to guide both the prompt and the parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Function Calling (Tool Use)  \n",
    "Some LLMs (like OpenAI GPT-4) support “function calling” where the model outputs a JSON object matching a specified schema, which can be directly used by downstream code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Few-shot Examples  \n",
    "Include examples of the desired structured output in your prompt.  \n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Text: \"LangChain is a framework for LLM applications.\"\n",
    "Output: {\"summary\": \"LangChain is a framework for LLM apps.\", \"keywords\": [\"LangChain\", \"framework\", \"LLM\"]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Post-processing  \n",
